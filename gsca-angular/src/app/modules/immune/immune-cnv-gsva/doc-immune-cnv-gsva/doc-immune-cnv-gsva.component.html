      <p>
        The Immune infiltration & Gene set CNV module is used to estimate the association between immune cells’ infiltrates and gene set CNV
        level.
      </p>
      <p>
        The infiltrates of 24 immune cells were evaluated through
        <a href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/ImmuCellAI/#!/" target="_blank">ImmuCellAI</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The gene set CNV represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated CNV status</span> of inputted gene set for each sample. A sample
        is classified into Amp. or Dele. group only when at least one gene in the input gene set is consistently amplified or deleted in
        this sample. If all genes in inputted gene set have no CNV in a sample, this sample is classified into WT group. When genes have
        inconsistent CNV status, for example, gene A was amplified in sample 1, gene B was deleted in sample 1, then sample 1 will be
        classified in Excluded group, which will not be considered in this analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The association between immune cells’ infiltrates and gene set CNV was evaluated by comparing the mean infiltrate between gene set
        CNV groups through Wilcoxon test (two groups comparison) or One way ANOVA test(more than two groups). The P value was adjusted by
        FDR.
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>This module provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <p class="phighlight">
        Note that input too much genes will make it difficult to interpret the gene set CNV result. Genes with functional relationship will
        be better for interpretation. It is worth noting that in some cases, a few genes in a gene set may have much higher frequency of CNV
        than most other genes in this gene set, which may lead to misunderstanding in result interpretation.
