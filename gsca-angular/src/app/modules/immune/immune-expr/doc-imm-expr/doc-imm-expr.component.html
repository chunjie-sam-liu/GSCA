      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The Immune infiltration & mRNA expression module is used to estimate the association between gene mRNA expression and immune cells’
        infiltrates through Spearman correlation analysis. The infiltrates of 24 immune cells were evaluated through
        <a href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/ImmuCellAI/#!/" target="_blank">ImmuCellAI</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The estimates of the abundance of 24 immune cell types were based on gene set signature (Document).
        <span class="phighlight"
          >Please avoid an overlap between input genes and the signature used to estimate the immune cell infiltrate</span
        >.

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including tables and figures.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>GSCA presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Cell type, Correlation, and FDR.</p>
        <p>
          Cell type: there are 24 types of immune cells, such as Dendritic cell, B cell, and et al.. More details are available on the
          <a href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA/#/document">document</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Correlation: the Spearman correlation coefficient between specific gene mRNA expression and specific immune cell’s infiltrate.
        </p>
        <p>FDR: the false discovery rate.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot :</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the cancer type button, GSCA will give you a bubble plot that presents the summary of the correlation between
            inputted genes’ mRNA expression and 24 immune cell types infiltrates in selected cancer. Bubble size correlates with FDR
            significance. The black outline border indicates FDR ≤ 0.05.
          </p>

          <li>Scatter plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking gene symbol buttons in the tables, users can get the detailed result of a single gene's mRNA expression correlated
            with a specific immune cell's infiltrate through a scatter plot, with a fitting line.
