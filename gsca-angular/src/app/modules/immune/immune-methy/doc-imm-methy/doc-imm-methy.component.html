      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The Immune infiltration & Methylation module is used to estimate the association between gene methylation and immune cells’
        infiltrates through Spearman correlation analysis. The infiltrates of 24 immune cells were evaluated through
        <a href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/ImmuCellAI/#!/" target="_blank">ImmuCellAI.</a>
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including tables and figures.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Cell type, Correlation, and FDR.</p>
        <p>
          Cell type: there are 24 types of immune cells, including Dendritic cell, B cell, and et al., please find the detailed information
          of 24 immune cells in the
          <a href="http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/GSCA/#/document">document</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Correlation: the Spearman correlation coefficient between a specific gene's methylation and a specific immune cell’s infiltrate.
        </p>
        <p>FDR: the false discovery rate.</p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the cancer type button, GSCA will give you a bubble plot that presents the summary of the correlation between the
            inputted genes’ methylation and 24 immune cell types' infiltrates in selected cancers. Bubble size correlates with FDR
            significance. The black outline border indicates FDR ≤ 0.05.
          </p>

          <li>Scatter plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking gene symbol buttons in the tables, users can get the correlation result between a single gene’s methylation and a
            specific immune cell's infiltrate through a scatter plot, with a fitting line.
