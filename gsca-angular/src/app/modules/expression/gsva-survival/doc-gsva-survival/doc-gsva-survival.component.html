      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For GSVA and Survival analysis, GSCA estimates the association between GSVA score and survival (includes OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI).
        GSCA used clinical data of tumor samples from 33 cancer types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncensored data was left out. Samples that have <span class="phighlight">competing risk</span> for death from cancer were filtered
        out (for DSS and DFI data).
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score and clinical survival data were merged by sample barcode, median GSVA score was used to divide tumor samples into high
        and low GSVA score groups. Then, R package
        <span class="phighlight">survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status of two groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Cox Proportional-Hazards</span> model and <span class="phighlight">Logrank tests</span> were performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancer’s sample population in an unsupervised manner, which
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly,
        <span class="phighlight"
          >the GSVA score represents the integrated level of the expression of gene set, which is positively correlate with gene
          expression</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">not obtain the survival results</span> in several cases, and there are some
        suggestions for survival analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">
          1. The OS data are available for all cancer types, while survival analysis for OS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, TGCT, and

          2. The PFS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for PFS is not recommended for PCPG

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher
          risk of death. Survival type including overall survival(OS), progression free survival(PFS), disease specific survival(DSS), and
          disease free survival(DFI). When the
          <span class="phighlight">Hazard ratio</span> of Higher GSVA group compared with Lower GSVA group is
          <span class="phighlight">greater than 1</span>, Higher GSVA group has higher risk of death, else Lower GSVA group has higher risk
          of death.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value though bubble color and size. The row is the survival type and the column is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high; the bubble size is
            positively correlate with the Cox P value significance. The black outline border of bubbles indicates Cox P value ≤ 0.05.
          </p>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves to compare the survival between high and low GSVA score in
            the specific cancer.
