      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For GSVA and Survival analysis, GSCA estimates the association between GSVA score and survival (includes OS and PFS). GSCA used
        clinical data of tumor samples from 33 cancer types. Uncensored data was left out. GSVA score and clinical survival data were merged
        by sample barcode, median GSVA score was used to divide tumor samples into high and low GSVA score groups. Then, R package
        <span class="phighlight">survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status of two groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Cox Proportional-Hazards</span> model and <span class="phighlight">Logrank tests</span> were performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancer’s sample population in an unsupervised manner, whcih
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly,
        <span class="phighlight"
          >the GSVA score represents the integrated level of the expression of gene set, which is positively correlate with gene
          expression</span
        >.
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher
          risk of death. Survival type including overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Column ‘Higher risk of death’
          indicates the group with higher risk of death. When the <span class="phighlight">median survival time</span> in group A is lower
          than that in group B, we think group A has higher risk of death. Or you can judge it according to other standards.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value though bubble color and size. The row is the survival type and the column is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high; the bubble size is
            positively correlate with the Cox P value significance. The black outline border of bubbles indicates Cox P value ≤ 0.05.
          </p>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves to compare the survival between high and low GSVA score in
            the specific cancer.
