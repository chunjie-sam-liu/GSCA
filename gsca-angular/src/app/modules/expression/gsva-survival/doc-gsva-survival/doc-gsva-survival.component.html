      <p>
        For GSVA and Survival analysis, GSCA estimates the association of the variation of gene set activity (represents as GSVA score) and
        survival (includes OS and PFS). GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out.
        Merging GSVA score and clinical survival data by sample barcode, median GSVA score was used to divide tumor samples into high and
        low GSVA groups. Then, we use R package survival to fit survival time and survival status of two groups. Cox Proportional-Hazards
        model and logrank tests were performed in every cancer.

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher
          risk of death. Survival type including OS and PFS. Column ‘Higher risk of death’ indicates the group with higher risk of death.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value though bubble color and size. The row is the survival type and column is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is positively
            correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
          </p>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between high and low GSVA score in specific cancer.</p>
