    <ul>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For expression and stage analysis, GSCA used 26 cancer types (HNSC, LUSC, COAD, STAD, LUAD, BRCA, UCEC, KIRC, READ, BLCA, CESC,
        THCA, TGCT, LIHC, PAAD, CRC, CHOL, ACC, UVM, SKCM, MESO, DLBC, UCS, KICH, KIRP, ESCA) clinical data from tumor samples. Merging mRNA
        expression and clinical stage data by sample barcode. The number of subgroup of stage must have at least 5 samples. The method used
        in this analysis depends on the number of subgroup in subtype with Wilcoxon test (n of stage groups == 2) and ANOVA test (n of stage
        groups > 2).
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Stage type, Stage I (mean expr./n), Stage II (mean expr./n), Stage
          III (mean expr./n), Stage IV (mean expr./n), P value and FDR. The stage I including stage IA, IB and IC et al, stage II, III and
          IV are grouped in a similar way. Stage type including pathologic stage and clinical stage.
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the FDR though bubble color and size. The row is the gene set symbol and column is the selected cancer types. The
            bubble color from blue to red represents the significance of FDR, bubble size is positively correlate with the significance.
            Black outline border indicates FDR < 0.05.
          </p>

          <li>Heat map:</li>
          <p>Presents the log2 RSEM expression of each gene in each stage.</p>

          <li>Trend plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the trend of gene expression from stage I to stage IV. Trend line color from blue to red represents the downregulate to
            upregulate tendency.
          </p>

          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws boxplot between stages of specific gene in specific cancer.</p>
