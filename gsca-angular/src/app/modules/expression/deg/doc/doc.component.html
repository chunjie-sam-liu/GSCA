      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        Based on normalized and batch corrected <span class="phighlight">RSEM</span> mRNA expression,
        <span class="phighlight">GSCA provides differential expression analysis for 14 TCGA cancer types </span>(THCA, KIRP, BLCA, LIHC,
        HNSC, BRCA, LUAD, PRAD, ESCA, KICH, LUSC, KIRC, STAD, COAD), which have over ten paired tumor and normal samples. The fold change is
        calculated by mean(Tumor) / mean(Normal), p-value was estimated by <span class="phighlight">t-test</span> and was further adjusted
        by FDR.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about differential expression analysis, including Cancer type, Gene symbol, Expr. Tumor, Expr.
          Normal, Fold change, FDR and # samples. [Expr.: Expression.]
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the fold change and FDR though bubble color and size. The row is the gene set symbol and column is the selected cancer
            types. The bubble color from purple to red represent the fold change between tumor vs normal. The size of dots are positively
            correlate with the FDR significance.
          </p>

          <li>Boxplot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA gives boxplot to compare the gene expression between tumor and normal in single cancer
            or pan-cancer.
