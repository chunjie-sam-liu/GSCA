      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The GSVA and subtype analysis is used to find subtype relevant changes of gene set expression. For this function, GSCA used clinical
        data of tumor samples from 9 cancer types (HNSC, LUSC, COAD, STAD, LUAD, GBM, BRCA, KIRC, BLCA). GSVA score and clinical subtype
        data were merged by sample barcode. The subtype subgroup must have at least 5 samples. GSCA compared the GSVA score among groups
        through <span class="phighlight">Wilcoxon test (number of subtype groups == 2)</span> and
        <span class="phighlight">ANOVA test (number of subtype groups > 2)</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner, which
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly,
        <span class="phighlight"
          >the GSVA score represents the integrated level of the expression of gene set, which is positively correlate with gene
          expression</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>Subtypes indicates molecular subtypes, if available, else indicates clustered subtypes.</p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, P value and GSVA score in each subtype (Subtype1(mean/n)).</p>
        <p>P value: the statistical significance estimated by Wilcoxon test (subtype groups == 2) and ANOVA test (subtype groups > 2).</p>
        <p>Subtype(mean/n)) presents the subtype names, mean GSVA score and number of samples.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>Compares the GSVA score between subtypes of specific cancer.</p>
        </ul>
