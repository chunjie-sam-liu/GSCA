      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For expression and survival analysis, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left
        out.Samples that have <span class="phighlight">competing risk</span> for death from cancer were filtered out (for DSS and DFI data).
      </p>
      <p>
        Merged mRNA expression and clinical survival data by sample barcode, <span class="phighlight">median mRNA value </span>was used to
        divide tumor samples into high and low expression groups. Then, we use R package survival to fit survival time and survival status
        within two groups. Cox Proportional-Hazards model and Logrank tests were performed for every gene in every cancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">not obtain the survival results</span> in several cases, and there are some
        suggestions for survival analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">
          1. The OS data are available for all cancer types, while survival analysis for OS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, TGCT, and
          THYM

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2. The PFS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for PFS is not recommended for PCPG
          <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          3. The DSS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for DSS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, PRAD, TGCT, THCA, and
          THYM<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          4. The DFI data are not available for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM. Survival analysis for DFI is not recommended for DLBC, GBM,
          KICH<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a>, MESO, PCPG,
          and READ.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher
          risk of death. Survival type including OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Column "Higher risk of death" indicates the group with higher risk of death. When the
          <span class="phighlight">Hazard ratio</span> of "Higher expr." group compared with "Lower expr." group is
          <span class="phighlight">greater than 1</span>, we think "Higher expr." group has higher risk of death, else "Lower expr." group
          has higher risk of death. When "Not applicable" presents in column "Higher risk of death", there is no survival result.
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value though bubble color and size. The row is the gene set symbol and column is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is positively
            correlate with the Cox P value significance. Black outline border indicates Cox P value â‰¤ 0.05.
          </p>

          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between high and low expression of specific gene in specific
            cancer. The genes with Kaplan-Meier Logrank test p-value less than 0.05 would be retained and gathered into final figure.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </ul>
