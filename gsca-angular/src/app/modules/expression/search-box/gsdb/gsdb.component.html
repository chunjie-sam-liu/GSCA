      </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      The interested gene set contain genes may from a whole pathway or a subset of a pathway or genes from differential expression analysis
      or genes from other biological conditions. If you are interested in gene set from pathways, please find the information and links of
      some commonly used pathway databases below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical biological signaling pathway, for example, can represent receptor-binding events, protein complexes, phosphorylation
      reactions, translocations and transcriptional regulation, with only a minimal set of symbols. Fortunately, many databases are
      providing gene set associated with biological pathways, here are the information of five commonly used pathway databases.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://geneontology.org/" target="_blank">GO: Gene Ontology database</a></li>
      <p>
        The GO resource provides a computational representation of current scientific knowledge about the functions of genes (or, more
        properly, the protein and non-coding RNA molecules produced by genes). It is widely used to support scientific research, and has
        been cited in tens of thousands of publications.
      </p>

      <li><a href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/" target="_blank">KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database</a></li>
      <p>
        KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the
        organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome
        sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies.
      </p>
      <li><a href="https://reactome.org/" target="_blank">Reactome Pathway Database</a></li>
      <p>
        Reactome is a freely available, open source relational database of signaling and metabolic molecules and their relations organized
        into biological pathways and processes. The core unit of the Reactome data model is the reaction. Entities (nucleic acids, proteins,
        complexes, vaccines, anti-cancer therapeutics and small molecules) participating in reactions form a network of biological
        interactions and are grouped into pathways.
      </p>
      <li><a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways" target="_blank">WikiPathways database</a></li>
      <p>
        WikiPathways was established to facilitate the contribution and maintenance of pathway information by the biology community.
        WikiPathways is an open, collaborative platform dedicated to the curation of biological pathways. WikiPathways thus presents a new
        model for pathway databases that enhances and complements ongoing efforts, such as KEGG, Reactome and Pathway Commons.
      </p>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/human/collections.jsp" target="_blank"
          >Human Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)</a
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        The MSigDB maintained 33195 gene sets, which are divided into 9 major collections, and several sub-collections. The 9 major
        collections include hallmark gene sets, positional gene sets, curated gene sets, regulatory target gene sets, computational gene
        sets, ontology gene sets, oncogenic signature gene sets, immunologic signature gene sets, and cell type signature gene sets.
      </p>
      <li>Other databases providing gene sets information</li>
      <p>
        Except for the databases we introduced above, there are also numerous databases devote themselves to summarize the relations between
        genes and biological pathways, biological processes, and diseases. For example:
