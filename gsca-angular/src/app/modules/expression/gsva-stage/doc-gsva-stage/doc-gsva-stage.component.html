      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For GSVA and stage analysis, GSCA used clinical data of tumor samples from 26 cancer types (HNSC, LUSC, COAD, STAD, LUAD, BRCA, UCEC, KIRC, READ, BLCA, CESC, THCA,
        TGCT, LIHC, PAAD, CRC, CHOL, ACC, UVM, SKCM, MESO, DLBC, UCS, KICH, KIRP, ESCA). GSVA score
        and clinical stage data were merged by sample barcode. The stage subgroup must have at least 5 samples. GSCA compared the GSVA score among groups through <span class="phighlight">Wilcoxon test (number of stage groups == 2)</span> and <span class="phighlight">ANOVA test (number of stage groups > 2)</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner, whcih
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly, <span class="phighlight">the GSVA score represents the integrated level of the expression of gene set, which is positively correlate with gene expression</span>. 
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Stage type, Stage I (mean/n), Stage II (mean/n), Stage III (mean/n),
          Stage IV (mean/n), P value and FDR. The stage I including stage IA, IB and IC et al, stage II, III and IV are grouped in a similar
          way. Stage type including pathologic stage and clinical stage.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>Provides GSVA score among stages.</p>
          <li>Heat map:</li>
          <p>Presents the profile of log2 RSEM expression of inputted genes in each stage.</p>
          <li>Trend plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the trend of gene expression from stage I to stage IV. Trend line color from blue to red represents the tendency from fall to
            rise.
