      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For GSVA and stage analysis, GSCA used 26 cancer types (HNSC, LUSC, COAD, STAD, LUAD, BRCA, UCEC, KIRC, READ, BLCA, CESC, THCA,
        TGCT, LIHC, PAAD, CRC, CHOL, ACC, UVM, SKCM, MESO, DLBC, UCS, KICH, KIRP, ESCA) clinical data from tumor samples. Merging GSVA score
        and clinical stage data by sample barcode. The number of subgroup of stage must have at least 5 samples. The method used in this
        analysis depends on the number of subgroup in stage with Wilcoxon test (n of stage groups == 2) and ANOVA test (n of stage groups >
        2).
      </p>
      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner, whcih
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly, the GSVA score represents the integrated level of the expression of gene set, which is positively correlate with gene expression. 
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Stage type, Stage I (mean/n), Stage II (mean/n), Stage III (mean/n),
          Stage IV (mean/n), P value and FDR. The stage I including stage IA, IB and IC et al, stage II, III and IV are grouped in a similar
          way. Stage type including pathologic stage and clinical stage.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>Provides GSVA score between stages in specific cancer.</p>
          <li>Heat map:</li>
          <p>Presents the log2 RSEM expression of each gene in each stage.</p>
          <li>Trend plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the trend of gene expression from stage I to stage IV. Trend line color from blue to red represents the downregulate to
            upregulate tendency.
