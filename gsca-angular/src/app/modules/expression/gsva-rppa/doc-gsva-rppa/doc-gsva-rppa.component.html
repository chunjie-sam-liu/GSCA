        GSVA and pathway activity module presents the correlation between GSVA score and pathway activity, which defined by pathway scores.

      <p>
        RPPA data from TCPA are used to calculate score for 7876 samples, 10 cancer related pathways and 32 cancer types. Reverse phase
        protein array (RPPA) is a high-throughput antibody-based technique with the procedures similar to that of Western blots. Proteins
        are extracted from tumor tissue or cultured cells, denatured by SDS, printed on nitrocellulose-coated slides followed by antibody
        probe (<a href="https://www.tcpaportal.org/tcpa/" target="_blank">TCPA database</a>), TCPA RPPA data are all from TCGA samples.

        The pathway we included in are: TSC/mTOR, RTK, RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Hormone ER, Hormone AR, EMT, DNA Damage Response, Cell Cycle,
        Apoptosis pathways. They are all famous cancer related pathways.

        RBN RPPA data were median-centered and normalized by standard deviation across all samples for each component to obtain the relative
        protein level. The pathway score is then the sum of the relative protein level of all positive regulatory components minus that of
        negative regulatory components in a particular pathway (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4887" target="_blank"
          >R. Akbani et al.</a

        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner, whcih
        was calculated through R package
