        GSVA and pathway activity module presents the correlation between GSVA score and pathway activity, which defined by pathway scores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from (<a href="https://www.tcpaportal.org/tcpa/" target="_blank">TCPA database</a>) were
        used to calculate pathway activity score of 10 cancer related pathways for 7876 samples (from TCGA database) from 32 cancer types.
        RPPA is a high-throughput antibody-based technique with the procedures similar to that of Western blots. Proteins are extracted from
        tumor tissue or cultured cells, denatured by SDS, printed on nitrocellulose-coated slides followed by antibody probe.

      <p>
        The pathway GSCA included are:
        <span class="phighlight"
          >TSC/mTOR, RTK, RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Hormone ER, Hormone AR, EMT, DNA Damage Response, Cell Cycle, Apoptosis pathways</span
        >. They are all famous cancer related pathways.
      </p>

      <p>
        RBN RPPA data were median-centered and normalized by standard deviation across all samples for each component to obtain the relative
        protein level. The pathway activity score is then the sum of the relative protein level of all positive regulatory components minus
        that of negative regulatory components in a particular pathway (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4887" target="_blank"
          >R. Akbani et al.</a
        >).
      </p>

      <p>
        GSVA score represents the variation of gene set activity over a specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner, which
        was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA.</a>
        Briefly, the GSVA score represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated level of the expression of gene set</span>, which is
        <span class="phighlight">positively correlate</span> with gene expression.
