      <p>
        For GSVA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) analysis, GSCA estimates variation of gene set activity (represents as GSVA score) over a
        specific cancerâ€™s sample population in an unsupervised manner. This module provides differential gene set activity analysis between
        tumor and normal samples. The GSVA score represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated level of the expression</span> of gene
        set, which is positively correlate with the expression of gene set. Therefore,
        <span class="phighlight"
          >if the GSVA score in tumor group is higher than that in adjacent group, it can indicate that the overall expression of the gene
          set in the tumor group is higher</span
        >. The GSVA score was calculated through R package
        <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7" target="_blank">GSVA</a>
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Tumor GSVA, Normal GSVA,Fold change and P value.</p>
        <p>Tumor GSVA: mean GSVA score in tumor samples.</p>
        <p>Normal GSVA: mean GSVA score in normal samples.</p>
        <p>Fold change: Log2 fold change of GSVA score in tumor samples compared with normal samples.</p>
        <p>P value: the statistical significance estimated by t test.</p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>Compares the GSVA score of inputted gene set between tumor and normal samples.</p>
        </ul>
