      <p>This module provides the KEGG/GO pathway enrichment for inputted gene set.</p>

      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        KEGG and GO pathway enrichment was performed by R package <span class="phighlight">clusterProfiler version 2.4.3</span>. The P value
        was adjusted to get FDR (Benjamini & Hochberg) and Q value. Only terms with FDR â‰¤ 0.05 were remained.
      </p>
      <p>GO pathway enrichment include the cellular component(CC), molecular function(MF) and biological process(BP).</p>
      <p><span class="phighlight">Note: the pathway enrichment result has nothing to do with the cancer types selected.</span></p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including the tables and figures.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>The table presents detailed information about the information of enriched pathways, P value, FDR and Q value.</p>
        <li>The result figure:</li>
        <p>
          The figure presents the top 10 pathways significantly enriched in each data source, including GO and KEGG database. If there are
          less than 10 pathways in a data source, show all.
        </p>
