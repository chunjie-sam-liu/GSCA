      <p>Methylation & expression module provides correlation analysis between methylation levels and mRNA expression levels.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The RSEM normalized mRNA expression data and Illumina Methylation 450k level 3 data were downloaded from TCGA database. Generally,
        there are multiple methylation sites in the region of one gene. Therefore, there are multiple tags store the methylation level of
        each site. We performed correlation analysis to filter the site most negatively correlate with gene expression into this module.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mRNA expression data and methylation data were merged by TCGA barcode.
        <span class="phighlight">Spearman correlation analysis</span> was performed to get the correlation between gene mRNA expression and
        methylation levels. P-value was adjusted by FDR.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Spearman correlation and FDR.</p>
        <p>Tag: the tag id of methylation site within the region of the specific gene.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Scatter plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the gene symbol buttons in the result table, a scatter plot will show you the detailed relationship between mRNA
            expression and methylation, with fitted line.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Represents the profile between inputted genes’ mRNA expression and methylation level. The blue bubbles represent negative
            correlations, the red bubbles represent positive correlations, the deeper of the color, the higher of the correlation. The
            bubble size is positively correlated with the significance of FDR. Black outline border indicates FDR ≤ 0.05.
