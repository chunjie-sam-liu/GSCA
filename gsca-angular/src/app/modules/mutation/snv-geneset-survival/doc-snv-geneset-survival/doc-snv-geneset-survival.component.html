      <p>Gene set SNV & survival module provides summary of the result of survival difference between gene set mutant and wide type.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The SNV data and clinical survival data were collected from TCGA database. SNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample
        barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gene set SNV represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated SNV status</span> of inputted gene set for each sample. A sample
        is classified into Mutant group only when at least one gene in the input gene set is mutated in the sample. If all genes in inputted
        gene set have no SNV in a sample, this sample is classified into WT group. Only samples have
        <span class="phighlight">deleterious mutants</span> are included in Mutant group.
      </p>
      <p>Survival analysis only performed for groups with <span class="phighlight">>2 samples</span>. And at least 2 groups are needed.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status two groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Cox Proportional-Hazards model and Logrank tests</span> were performed to test the survival difference
        between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">could not get the survival results</span> in sevaral cases, , and there are some
        suggestions for survival analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">
          1. The OS data are avaliable for all cancer types, while survival analysis for OS is not recommded for DLBC, PCPG, TGCT, and THYM

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2. The PFS data are not avaliable for LAML. Survival analysis for PFS is not recommded for PCPG

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          3. The DSS data are not avaliable for LAML. Survival analysis for DSS is not recommded for DLBC, PCPG, PRAD, TGCT, THCA, and
          THYM<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a>.

        <li class="lilight">
          4. The DFI data are not avaliable for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM. Survival analysis for DFI is not recommded for DLBC, GBM, KICH,
          MESO, PCPG, and READ<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          5. The inputted gene set do not have enough mutation, which lead the number of groups (<span class="phighlight"
            >have > 2 samples</span
          >) that used for survival comparing is not enough (two groups are needed).
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">6. HR equal to 1.</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher risk of death.
        </p>
        <p>Survival type including OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI.</p>
        <p>Hazard Ratio: the risk of death of Mutant group compared with WT group.</p>
        <p>
          Higher risk of death indicates the group with higher risk of death. When the <span class="phighlight">Hazard ratio</span> of
          Mutant group compared with low WT group is <span class="phighlight">greather than 1</span>, we think Mutant group has higher risk
          of death, else WT group has higher risk of death.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between WT and Mutant (deleterious mutation) groups of specific
            gene in specific cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value through bubble color and size. The column is selected cancer types and the row is
            survival type (OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI). The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble
            size is positively correlate with the Cox P value significance. Black outline border indicates Cox P value â‰¤ 0.05.
