      <p>Geneset SNV & survival module provides summary of survival result between gene set mutant and wide type.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For Geneset SNV & survival module, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out.
        Merging SNV data and clinical survival data by sample barcode, tumor samples were divided into WT and Mutant (effective mutation)
        groups. Only when a sample has at least one gene (within inputted gene set) with effective mutation would be classified into mutant
        group. R package survival was used to fit survival time and survival status within two groups. Cox Proportional-Hazards model and
        logrank tests were performed for every gene in each cancer.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher risk of death.
          Survival type including OS and PFS. Column ‘Higher risk of death’ indicates the group with higher risk of death.
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between WT and Mutant (effective mutation) groups of specific gene
            in specific cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value through bubble color and size. The the column is selected cancer types and the row
            is survival type (OS and PFS). The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is
            positively correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
