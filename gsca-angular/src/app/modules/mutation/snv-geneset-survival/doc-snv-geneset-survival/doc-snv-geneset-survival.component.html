      <p>Gene set SNV & survival module provides summary of the result of survival difference between gene set mutant and wide type.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The SNV data and clinical survival data were collected from TCGA database. SNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample
        barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gene set SNV represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated SNV status</span> of inputted gene set for each sample. A sample
        is classified into the Mutant group only when at least one gene in the input gene set is mutated in the sample. If all genes in
        inputted gene set have no SNV in a sample, this sample is classified into WT group. Only samples have
        <span class="phighlight">deleterious mutants</span> are included in the Mutant group.
      </p>
      <p>Survival analysis only performed for groups with <span class="phighlight">>2 samples</span>. And at least 2 groups are needed.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status two groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Cox Proportional-Hazards model and Logrank tests</span> were performed to test the survival difference
        between groups.
      </p>
      <p><span class="phighlight">There are some suggestions for survival analysis:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">Data availability</li>
        <p>
          The OS data are available for all cancer types.<br />
          The PFS data are not available for LAML.<br />
          The DSS data are not available for LAML.<br />
          The DFI data are not available for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM.
        </p>
        <li class="lilight">
          The survival analysis can be performed as long as there are survival events. However, there are few things you should know about
          the endpoints of TCGA OS, PFI, DFI, and DSS data (<a

        </li>
        <p>
          ACC: number of events is small; <br />
          BRCA: need a longer follow-up for OS and DSS; <br />
          CHOL: sample size is too small for OS, DSS, DFI, and PFI; <br />
          DLBC: sample size and number of events are too small, and need a longer follow-up; <br />
          GBM: number of disease-free cases is small;<br />
          KICH: number of events is too small, and need a longer follow-up; <br />
          KIRC: number of events is small; <br />
          LGG: need a longer follow-up for OS and DSS; <br />

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including the tables and figures.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>
          The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher risk
          of death.
        </p>
        <p>Survival types include OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI.</p>
        <p>Hazard Ratio: the risk of death of the Mutant group compared with WT group.</p>
        <p>
          The 'Higher risk of death' indicates the group with a higher risk of death. When the
          <span class="phighlight">Hazard ratio</span> of the Mutant group compared with the low WT group is
          <span class="phighlight">greater than 1</span>, we think the Mutant group has a higher risk of death, and else WT group has a
          higher risk of death.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking any one button in table, GSCA would draw the Kaplan-Meier curves between WT and Mutant (deleterious mutation) groups
            of specific gene in specific cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            This plot presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value through bubble color and size. The column is selected cancer types and the
            row is survival type (OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI). The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high,
            bubble size is positively correlate with the Cox P value significance. Black outline border indicates Cox P value â‰¤ 0.05.
