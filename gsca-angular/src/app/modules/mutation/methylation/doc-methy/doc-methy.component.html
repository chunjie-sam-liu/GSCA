      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        Illumina HumanMethylation 450k level 3 data were downloaded from TCGA database. In total, 14 cancer types (THCA, KIRP, BLCA, LIHC, HNSC,
        BRCA, LUAD, PRAD, ESCA, KICH, LUSC, KIRC, STAD, COAD), which have more than 10 paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor samples, were selected and processed into this analysis.
      </p>
      <p>Generally, there are multiple methylation sites in the region of one gene. Therefore, there are multiple tags store the methylation level of each site. Before differential methylation analysis, we performed correlation analysis to filter the site most negatively correlate with gene expression. </p>
      <p>
        The fold change is calculated by mean(Tumor) / mean(Normal), p-value was estimated by t-test and was further adjusted by FDR.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Tag, Methylation(Tumor-Normal), Trend, P value and FDR.
        </p>
        <p>Tag: </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the fold change and FDR through bubble color and size. The row is the gene symbol and column is the selected cancer
            types. The bubble color from blue to red represent the methlation difference between tumor vs normal. The size dot is positively
            correlate with the FDR significance. The dot was filtered by FDR significance (FDR < 0.05).
          </p>

          <li>Box plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA gives boxplot to compare the gene expression between tumor and normal in single cancer
            (click cancer type name) or pan-cancer (click gene symbol name).
          </p>
