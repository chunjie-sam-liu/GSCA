      <p>Geneset CNV & survival module provides summary of survival between gene set CNV and wide type.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For Geneset CNV & survival module, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out.
        Merging CNV data and clinical survival data by sample barcode, tumor samples were divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups. Only when
        inputted gene set have consistent CNV (both amplification or deletion or without CNV) in a sample, this sample would be classified
        into one group. R package survival was used to fit survival time and survival status within two groups. Logrank tests were performed
        to test the difference between groups.

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS and PFS.</p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Represents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value through bubble color and size. The the column is selected cancer types and the
            row is survival type (OS and PFS). The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size
            is positively correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
