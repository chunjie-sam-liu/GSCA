      <p>Gene set CNV & survival module provides summary of survival between gene set CNV and wide type.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The clinical survival data and CNV data were downloaded from TCGA database. And the CNV data and clinical survival data were merged
        by sample barcode. Samples that have <span class="phighlight">competing risk</span> for death from cancer were filtered out (for DSS
        and DFI data).
      </p>
      <p>
        The gene set CNV represents the <span class="phighlight">integrated CNV status</span> of inputted gene set for each sample. A sample
        is classified into Amp. or Dele. group only when at least one gene in the input gene set is consistently amplified or deleted in
        this sample. If all genes in inputted gene set have no CNV in a sample, this sample is classified into WT group. When genes have
        inconsistent CNV status, for example, gene A was amplified in sample 1, gene B was deleted in sample 1, then sample 1 will be
        classified in Excluded group, which will not be considered in this analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survival analysis was performed when at least 2 groups with <span class="phighlight">more than 2 samples</span>. And groups with < 2
        samples were also remained to draw survival curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival </span>was used to fit survival time and survival status within gene set CNV groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Logrank test</span> was performed to test the survival difference between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">not obtain the survival results</span> in several cases, and there are some
        suggestions for survival analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">
          1. The OS data are available for all cancer types, while survival analysis for OS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, TGCT, and
          THYM

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2. The PFS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for PFS is not recommended for PCPG

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          3. The DSS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for DSS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, PRAD, TGCT, THCA, and

        <li class="lilight">
          4. The DFI data are not available for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM. Survival analysis for DFI is not recommended for DLBC, GBM, KICH,
          MESO, PCPG, and READ<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          5. The inputted gene set do not have enough CNVs, which lead the number of groups (with at least 2 samples) that used for survival
          comparing is not enough (at least two groups are needed).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI.
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Logrank p value through bubble color and size. The column is selected cancer types and the row is survival type
            (OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI). The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is
            positively correlate with the significance of Logrank P value. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value â‰¤ 0.05.
