      <p>This module analyze the relationship between CNV and mRNA expression through correlation analysis.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The RSEM normalized mRNA expression data and CNV data were downloaded from TCGA database. The mRNA expression data and CNV raw data
        were merged by TCGA barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="phighlight">Spearman correlation</span> analysis was performed to get the correlation between gene mRNA expression and
        CNV. P-value was adjusted by FDR.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method has been employed in
        <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/12/2004.full">A. Schlattl et al., 2011</a> to correlate copy-number to transcription
        data.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including the tables and figures.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Spearman correlation and FDR.</p>
        <p>Spearman correlation indicates the correlation coefficient.</p>
        <p>FDR indicates the adjusted P value using FDR method.</p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Scatter plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the gene symbol buttons in the result table, a scatter plot will show you the detailed relationship between mRNA
            expression and CNV, with fitted line.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Bubble plot represents the profile between inputted genes’ mRNA expression and CNV level. Blue bubbles represent negative
            correlations, red bubbles represent positive correlations, the deeper of the color, the higher of the correlation. Bubble size
            is positively correlated with the FDR significance. Black outline border indicates FDR ≤ 0.05.
