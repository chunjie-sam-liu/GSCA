      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>The RSEM normalized mRNA expression data and CNV data were downloaded from TCGA database.</p>
      <p>
        The mRNA expression data and CNV data were merged by TCGA barcode. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to get the correlation between gene mRNA expression and CNV. P-value was adjusted by FDR.
      </p>
      <p>
        This method has been employed in
        <a href="https://genome.cshlp.org/content/21/12/2004.full">A. Schlattl et al, 2011</a> to relate copy-number to transcriptome
        sequencing data.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Spearman correlation and FDR.</p>
        <p>Spearman correlation indicates the correlation coeeficient.</p>
        <p>FDR indicates the adjusted P value using FDR method.</p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Scatter plot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the gene symbol buttons in the result table, a scatter plot will show you the detailed relationship between mRNA expression and CNV, with fitted line.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Bubble plot represents the profile between inputted genes’ mRNA expression and CNV level. Blue bubbles represent negative
            correlations, red bubbles represent positive correlations, the deeper of the color, the higher of the correlation. Bubble size is
            positively correlated with the FDR significance. Black outline border indicates FDR < 0.05.
