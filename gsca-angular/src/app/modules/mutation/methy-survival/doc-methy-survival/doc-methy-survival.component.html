      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For Methylation & survival module, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out.
        Merging methylation data and clinical survival data by sample barcode, median value was used to divide tumor samples into high and
        low methylation groups. Then, R package survival was used to fit survival time and survival status within two groups. Cox
        Proportional-Hazards model was constructed to get the risk ratio of high methylation compared with low methylation. Logrank test was
        performed to compare the overall survival difference between groups using an estimate of Logrank P value.

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher risk of death.
          This table showing the result of OS. Column ‘Higher risk of death’ indicates the group with higher risk of death.
        </p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value through bubble color and size. The column is gene symbols and row is the selected
            cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is positively
            correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
          </p>

          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between methylation groups of specific gene in specific
            cancer.
