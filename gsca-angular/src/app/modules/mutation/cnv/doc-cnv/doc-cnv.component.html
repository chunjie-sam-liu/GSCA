      <p>The CNV summary module presents the summary of inputted genesâ€™ CNV in selected cancer types.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through
        <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTIC2.0</a>, which attempts to identify
        significantly altered regions of amplification or deletion across sets of patients.
      </p>
      <p><span class="phighlight">According to the GISTIC score derived from GISTIC, and indicate the copy-number level per gene:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">-2 or Deep Deletion indicates a deep loss, possibly a <span class="phighlight">homozygous deletion</span>.</li>
        <li class="lilight">
          -1 or Shallow Deletion indicates a shallow loss, possibly a <span class="phighlight">heterozygous deletion</span>.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">0 is diploid.</li>
        <li class="lilight">
          1 or Gain indicates a low-level gain (a few additional copies copies, <span class="phighlight">often broad</span>), possibly a
          <span class="phighlight">heterozygous amplification</span>.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2 or Amplification indicate a high-level amplification (more copies, <span class="phighlight">often focal</span>), possibly a
          <span class="phighlight">homozygous amplification</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>GSCA summarizes the above four types (GISTIC score: -2, -1, 1, 2) of CNV in inputted genes in selected cancer types.</p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including the tables and figures.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>
          presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Total amp.(%), Total dele.(%), Hete amp.(%), Hete dele.(%), Homo
          amp.(%) and Homo dele.(%).
        </p>
        <p>Total amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number amplification, including heterozygous and homozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Total dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number deletion, including heterozygous and homozygous deletion.</p>
        <p>Hete amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number heterozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Hete dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number heterozygous deletion.</p>
        <p>Homo amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number homozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Homo dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number homozygous deletion.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Oncoplot:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking the gene symbol button in the table result, an oncoplot presents the distribution of CNV classes of a specific gene.
          </p>

          <li>CNV pie plot:</li>
          <p>
            Gives you a global profile that shows the constitute of Heterozygous/Homozygous CNV of each gene in each cancer. A pie
            represents the proportion of different types of CNV of one gene in one cancer, different color represents different CNV type.
          </p>

          <li>Heterozygous CNV plot:</li>
          <p>
            Using bubbles to represent the percentage of heterozygous CNV, including heterozygous amplification and deletion of each gene in
            each cancer. The bubble size is positively correlate with percentage, the bubble color blue represents deletion, red represents
            amplification. The heterozygous CNV is generally happened, so the plot will full of points.
          </p>

          <li>Homozygous CNV plot:</li>
          <p>
            Similar to Heterozygous CNV plot, but including the percentage of homozygous amplification and deletion of each gene in each
            cancer. Most studies mainly focus on homozygous CNV at present, such as cBioPortal.
