      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>The CNV summary module presents the summary of inputted genesâ€™ CNV in selected cancer types.</p>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTICS2.0</a>, which attempts to identify significantly altered regions of amplification or deletion across sets of patients. 
      </p>
      <p class="phighlight">According to the GISTIC result, These levels are derived from GISTIC, and indicate the copy-number level per gene:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">-2 or Deep Deletion indicates a deep loss, possibly a homozygous deletion</li>
        <li class="lilight">-1 or Shallow Deletion indicates a shallow loss, possibly a heterozygous deletion
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">0 is diploid</li>
        <li class="lilight">1 or Gain indicates a low-level gain (a few additional copies copies, often broad), possibly a heterozygous amplification</li>
        <li class="lilight">2 or Amplification indicate a high-level amplification (more copies, often focal), possibly a homozygous amplification</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>GSCA summarizes the above four types of CNV in inputted genes in selected cancer types.</p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Total amp.(%), Total dele.(%), Hete amp.(%), Hete dele.(%), Homo amp.(%) and Homo dele.(%).
        </p>
        <p>Total amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number amplification, including heterozygous and homozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Total dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number deletion, including heterozygous and homozygous deletion.</p>
        <p>Hete amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number heterozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Hete dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number heterozygous deletion.</p>
        <p>Homo amp.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number homozygous amplification.</p>
        <p>Homo dele.(%): the percentage of samples with copy number homozygous deletion.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Oncoplot:</li>
          <p>By clicking the gene symbol button in the table result, an oncoplot presents the CNV type distribution of a specific gene.</p>

          <li>CNV pie plot:</li>
          <p>
            Gives you a global profile that shows the constitute of Heterozygous/Homozygous CNV of each gene in each cancer. A pie
            represents the proportion of different types of CNV of one gene in one cancer, different color represents different CNV type.
          </p>

          <li>Heterozygous CNV plot:</li>
          <p>
            Using bubbles to represent the percentage of heterozygous CNV, including amplification and deletion percentage of heterozygous
            CNV about each gene in each cancer. The bubble size is positively correlate with percentage, the bubble color bule represents
            deletion, red represents amplification. The heterozygous CNV is generally happened, so the plot will full of points.
          </p>

          <li>Homozygous CNV plot:</li>
          <p>
            Similar to Heterozygous CNV plot, but including amplification and deletion percentage of homozygous CNV about each gene in each
            cancer. Most of researchs including cBioPortal mainly focus on homozygous CNV at present.
