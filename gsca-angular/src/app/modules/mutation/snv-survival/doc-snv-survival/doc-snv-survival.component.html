    <ul>
      <p>SNV & survival module provides survival analysis for gene SNV.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For SNV & survival module, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out. Merging
        SNV data and clinical survival data by sample barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tumor samples were divided into WT and Mutant (effective mutation) groups. R
        package survival was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Cox Proportional-Hazards model and logrank tests were performed to test the survival difference between WT and Mutant groups.
      </p>
      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Logrank P value, Higher
          risk of death. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Survival type including OS and PFS. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Higher risk of death indicates the group with higher risk of death.
          When the median survival time of Mutant group is lower than other WT group, we think Mutant group has higher risk of death. Of cource you can judge it according to other standards.
        </p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between WT and Mutant (effective mutation) groups of specific gene in specific cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is positively
            correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
