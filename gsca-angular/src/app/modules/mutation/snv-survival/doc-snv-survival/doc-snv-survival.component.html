    <ul>
      <p>SNV & survival module provides survival analysis for gene SNV.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        The SNV data and clinical survival data were collected from TCGA database. SNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample
        barcode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tumor samples were divided into Mutant group when the specific gene is mutated (<span class="phighlight">deleterious mutants</span>)
        in these samples.
      </p>
      <p>Survival analysis only performed for groups with <span class="phighlight">> 2 samples</span>. And at least 2 groups are needed.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival </span>was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups.
        <span class="phighlight">Cox Proportional-Hazards model and Logrank tests</span> were performed to test the survival difference
        between WT and Mutant groups.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value, Hazard Ratio, Cox P value, Higher
          risk of death, # of Mutant, and # of WT.
        </p>
        <p>Survival type including OS and PFS.</p>
        <p>
          Higher risk of death indicates the group with higher risk of death. When the <span class="phighlight">Hazard ratio</span> of
          Mutant group compared with low WT group is <span class="phighlight">greather than 1</span>, we think Mutant group has higher risk
          of death, else WT group has higher risk of death. When "Not applicable" presents in column ‘Higher risk of death’, there is no
          hazard ratio result for judgement.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">get the "Not applicable"</span> in sevaral cases,including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lilight">1. The PFS data are not avaliable for LAML.</li>
          <li class="lilight">
            2. A gene does not have enough mutation, which lead the number of groups (<span class="phighlight">have > 2 samples</span>) that
            used for survival comparing is not enough (two groups are needed).
          </li>
          <li class="lilight">3. HR equal to 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p># of Mutant and # of WT indicate the number of samples (have survival data) with and without SNV, respectively.</p>
        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between WT and Mutant (deleterious mutation) groups of
            specific gene in specific cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and Cox p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the hazard ratio from low to high, bubble size is positively
            correlate with the Cox P value significance. Black outline border indicates Cox P value ≤ 0.05.
          </p>
