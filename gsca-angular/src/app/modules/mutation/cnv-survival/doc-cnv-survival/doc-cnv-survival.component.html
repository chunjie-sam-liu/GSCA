      <p>CNV & survival module provides summary of survival differences between CNV and wide type of each gene.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTICS2.0</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        CNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample barcode. The samples were divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups. <span class="phighlight">R package
        survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Logrank tests were performed to test the survival difference 
        between groups.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <p>Note that in some cases, samples with survival data are not cover samples with CNV data, therefore, the <span class="phighlight">number of samples in each CNV groups may little different from CNV summary modules</span>. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS and PFS.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups of specific gene in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the significance of Logrank P value from low to high, the bubble
            size is positively correlated with the significance of Logrank P value. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
