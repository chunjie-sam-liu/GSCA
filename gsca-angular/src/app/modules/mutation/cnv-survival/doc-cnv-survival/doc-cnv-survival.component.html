      <p>CNV & survival module provides summary of survival differences between CNV and wide type of each gene.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through
        <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTIC2.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSCA used clinical data of tumor samples from 33 cancer types. Uncensored data was left out. Samples that have
        <span class="phighlight">competing risk</span> for death from cancer were filtered out (for DSS and DFI data).
      </p>
      <p>
        CNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample barcode. The samples were divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups.
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Logrank tests
        were performed to test the survival difference between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The p value of survival analysis was get from groups with <span class="phighlight"> ≥2 samples</span>. But the group with < 2
        samples were also remained to perform draw the survival curve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">not obtain the survival results</span> in several cases, and there are some
        suggestions for survival analysis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">
          1. The OS data are available for all cancer types, while survival analysis for OS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, TGCT, and
          THYM

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2. The PFS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for PFS is not recommended for PCPG

        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          3. The DSS data are not available for LAML. Survival analysis for DSS is not recommended for DLBC, PCPG, PRAD, TGCT, THCA, and
          THYM<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          4. The DFI data are not available for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM. Survival analysis for DFI is not recommended for DLBC, GBM, KICH,
          MESO, PCPG, and READ<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(18)30229-0" target="_blank">(Liu et al, Cell, 2018)</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li class="lilight">
          5. A gene does not have enough CNVs, which lead the number of groups (with at least 2 samples) that used for survival comparing is
          not enough (at least two groups are needed).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <p>
        Note that in some cases, samples with survival data are not cover samples with CNV data, therefore, the
        <span class="phighlight">number of samples in each CNV groups may little different from CNV summary modules</span>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS, PFS,
          DSS, and DFI.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups of specific gene in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the selected cancer
            types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the significance of Logrank P value from low to high, the bubble size is
            positively correlated with the significance of Logrank P value. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value ≤ 0.05.
