      <p>CNV & survival module provides summary of survival differences between CNV and wide type of each gene.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        For CNV & survival module, GSCA used 33 cancer types clinical data from tumor samples, some uncensored data was left out. Merging
        CNV data and clinical survival data by sample barcode, and samples were further divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups. R package
        survival was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Logrank tests were performed to test the difference
        between groups.
      </p>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS and PFS.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups of specific gene in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Hazard ratio and logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the
            selected cancer types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the Logrank P value significance from low to high, bubble
            size is positively correlate with the Logrank P value significance. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value < 0.05.
