      <p>CNV & survival module provides summary of survival differences between CNV and wide type of each gene.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through
        <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTIC2.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        GSCA used clinical data of tumor samples from 33 cancer types. Uncensored data was left out. Samples that have
        <span class="phighlight">competing risk</span> for death from cancer were filtered out (for DSS and DFI data).
      </p>
      <p>
        CNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample barcode. The samples were divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups.
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Logrank tests
        were performed to test the survival difference between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The p value of survival analysis was get from groups with <span class="phighlight"> ≥2 samples</span>. But the group with < 2
        samples were also remained to perform draw the survival curve.
      </p>
      <p><span class="phighlight">There are some suggestions for survival analysis:</span></p>

        <li class="lilight">Data availability</li>
        <p>
          The OS data are available for all cancer types.<br />
          The PFS data are not available for LAML.<br />
          The DSS data are not available for LAML.<br />
          The DFI data are not available for LAML, SKCM, THYM, and UVM.

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <p>
        Note that in some cases, samples with survival data are not cover samples with CNV data, therefore, the
        <span class="phighlight">number of samples in each CNV groups may little different from CNV summary modules</span>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Table:</li>
        <p>
          The table presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including
          OS, PFS, DSS, and DFI.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures, including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>
            By clicking any one button in the table, GSCA would draw the Kaplan-Meier curves for a groups of specific gene in specific
            cancer.
          </p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the selected cancer
            types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the significance of Logrank P value from low to high, the bubble size is
            positively correlated with the significance of Logrank P value. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value ≤ 0.05.
