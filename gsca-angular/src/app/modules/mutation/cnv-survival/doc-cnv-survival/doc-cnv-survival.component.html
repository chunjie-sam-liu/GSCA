      <p>CNV & survival module provides summary of survival differences between CNV and wide type of each gene.</p>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>
        CNV data of 11495 samples were downloaded from TCGA database, and were processed through
        <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r41">GISTICS2.0</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survival analysis was performed when at least 2 groups with <span class="phighlight">more than 5 samples</span>. And groups with ≤ 5
        samples were also remained to perform survival analysis, togather with groups have more than 5 samples.
      </p>
      <p>
        CNV data and clinical survival data were merged by sample barcode. The samples were divided into WT, Amp. and Dele. groups.
        <span class="phighlight">R package survival</span> was used to fit survival time and survival status within groups. Logrank tests
        were performed to test the survival difference between groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the users may <span class="phighlight">could not get the survival results (shown as --)</span> in sevaral cases,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="lilight">1. The PFS data are not avaliable for some cancers, including TGCT, LAML, CHOL, UVM, and THYM.</li>
        <li class="lilight">
          2. A gene does not have enough CNVs, which lead the number of groups (with at least 2 samples) that used for survival comparing is
          not enough (at least two groups are needed).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>Interpretation</li>
      <p>GSCA provides two forms of results, including table and figure.</p>
      <p>
        Note that in some cases, samples with survival data are not cover samples with CNV data, therefore, the
        <span class="phighlight">number of samples in each CNV groups may little different from CNV summary modules</span>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The result table:</li>
        <p>
          Presents detailed information about Cancer type, Gene symbol, Survival type, Logrank P value. Survival type including OS and PFS.
        </p>
        <p></p>

        <li>GSCA provides result figures including:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Kaplan-Meier curves:</li>
          <p>By clicking buttons in table result, GSCA draws Kaplan-Meier curves between groups of specific gene in specific cancer.</p>

          <li>Bubble plot:</li>
          <p>
            Presents the Logrank p value though bubble color and size. The column is the gene set symbol and row is the selected cancer
            types. The bubble color from blue to red represents the significance of Logrank P value from low to high, the bubble size is
            positively correlated with the significance of Logrank P value. Black outline border indicates Logrank P value ≤ 0.05.
